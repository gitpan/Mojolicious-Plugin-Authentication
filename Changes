Revision history for Mojolicious-Plugin-Authentication

22/04/2011  0.5.0
    *   Changed version number (again) due to earlier module using version and qv(0.03) resulting in
        a version number 0.3.0.
    !   Fixed a bunch of bugs induced by coding-while-asleep, courtesy of Andre Parker 
    +   Added functional test using Test::Mojo so we can all be sure the damn plugin
        works the way it should :)
    

21/04/2011  0.04 (not released)
    *   Changed from using ExtUtils::MakeMaker to Module::Build
    *   Removed the dependency on MojoX::Session and Mojolicious::Plugin::Session
    !   As a side effect of the above, this plugin no longer handles session data storage,
        that has become something you'll have to deal with yourself. 

0.01 - 0.03 
    Changes history wasn't being kept, but suffice to say a lot was done.
